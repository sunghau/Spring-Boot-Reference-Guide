Hopefully this section has provided you with some of the Spring Boot basics, and got you on your way to writing your own applications. If you’re a task-oriented type of developer you might want to jump over to spring.io and check out some of the getting started guides that solve specific “How do I do that with Spring” problems; we also have Spring Boot-specific How-to reference documentation.

The Spring Boot repository has also a bunch of samples you can run. The samples are independent of the rest of the code (that is you don’t need to build the rest to run or use the samples).

Otherwise, the next logical step is to read Part III, “Using Spring Boot”. If you’re really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about Spring Boot features.
